description: >-
  Organic certification verifies that a farm or handling facility located anywhere in the world
  complies with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) organic regulations and allows the
  operation to sell, label, and represent their products as organic. The USDA regulations describe
  the specific standards required for the operation to use the word “organic” or the USDA organic
  seal on food, feed, or fiber products. The USDA National Organic Program (NOP) administers these
  regulations, with substantial input from its citizen advisory board and the public.
