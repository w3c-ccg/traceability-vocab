  A data credential is data about something identified with a key credential. While anyone can make any declaration about an object, for that data to be trusted, it has to be authorised in some fashion. This can vary depending on the type of data and the business process in which it is used. For example, a brand owner can be trusted to declare the brand name, description, size and unit of measure, and much more about their own product. The brand owner may not be trusted, however, to declare certain product certifications (e.g., Halal and conformance to other religious practices) or to provide high-quality data for critical supply chain processes (e.g., dimensions and weights for planogram purposes). In such cases, the brand owner would have to authorise other parties that are trusted to provide that data.
  On the other hand, an anonymous consumer can provide a review of the product without any authorisations provided by the brand owner but can increase trust in the review by referencing a proof of purchase credential for the product.
  Ultimately, the rules governing which declarations may be made, by whom, and with what combination of data authorisation and data certification credentials depend on the data being provided.
  The key authorisation and data certification credential URIs do not need to be resolvable, and the fact that this credential is presented does not require that the other credentials be presented as well. It is up to the holder to decide whether to present the other credentials alongside this one, and up to the verifier to decide whether or not to accept them (or accept their absence).

      keyAuthorisation:
        description: Reference to a credential that authorises the issuer to declare data for the credential subject (the key). Normally, this is the key credential itself, in which case the issuer of this and the key credential must be the same. For data that is declared by other parties on behalf of the issuer of the key credential, a delegation credential may be provided instead. In some circumstances, where the issuer of the data declaration is entirely independent, the key authorisation may be entirely outside of the GS1 system (e.g., a proof-of-purchase Verifiable Credential for a product review).
        type: string
      dataCertification:
        description: List of references to credentials that certify that the issuer is competent to declare data of the given type. This would be used, for example, to declare that a solution provider is certified in accordance with the GS1 Package Measurement Rules Standard would assure the verifier of the credential that the planogram data contained in the credential is accurate. The combination of a data authorisation credential from the brand owner for planogram data along with the GS1 Package Measurement Rules Standard data certification credential would confirm to the verifier that the solution provider is both authorised and competent to provide the data. Multiple data certification credentials may be provided, which may address situations where multiple certifying parties exist and different users require different certifications. Itâ€™s not always necessary to have a data certification credential to match a key delegation credential, as data certification may be implied by the issuer of the credential (e.g., a Halal or other religious practice certification authority) that is trusted by the community that is interested in the data.
