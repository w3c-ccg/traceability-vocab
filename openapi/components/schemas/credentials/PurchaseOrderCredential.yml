description: >-
  A purchaser's written offer to a supplier formally stating all terms and
  conditions of a proposed transaction. Sometimes, in a certain number of international
  trade operations, international sale contracts are not made. In these cases, it is usual to
  confirm the operation with an international purchase order. This practise is usual for
  sales of a small amount of money and for repetitive sales to the same client concerning
  products which are not very complex or for products that do not have a high added
  value. Usually it is the exporter who issues this document. Nevertheless, sometimes,
  companies with international purchase experience (such trading companies) have
  their own international purchase order template where they establish the purchase
  conditions to their suppliers.
