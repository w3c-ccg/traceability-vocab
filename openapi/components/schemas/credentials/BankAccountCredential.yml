  Credential representing the account information from the account holder's financial institution's KYC (Know Your Customer) process.
  Financial institutions wishing to adopt digital currency solutions may require mapping of existing customer identities to cryptographic key identifiers
  that can enable financial transactions to be processed in compliance with financial regulations. The information gathered is initiated from the Travel Rule
  stated under FinCEN https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/advisory/advissu7.pdf 
  and FINTRAC https://www.fintrac-canafe.gc.ca/guidance-directives/transaction-operation/travel-acheminement/1-eng
