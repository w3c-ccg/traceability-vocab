  The Plant Systems Audit (PSA) program provides an unbiased, third party audit of a facility's
  food safety and quality systems. The frequency and scope of the audits can be tailored to meet an
  applicant's needs. AMS audits are conducted during actual production. This voluntary, user fee
  auditing service is available upon request and can allow a firm to gain objective information
  about a supplier. A company may also request these services to gain an objective assessment of
  their own operations.
