  The Food Defense Verification Program satisfies the requirements of the USDA Foods commodity
  purchase programs, specifically that all qualified contractors and subcontractors have a
  documented and operational food defense plan that provides for the security of a plant's
  production processes and includes the storage and transportation of pre-production raw materials
  and other ingredients and post-production finished products. The prospective suppliers plan
  must be audited and approved prior to bid opening on a USDA Foods solicitation, and subsequently
  audited on an annual basis.
