      delegation:
        description: References to the licence or key credentials that have been delegated to the credential subject. Within GS1, provides a complete chain to the GS1 Prefix licence credential issued by GS1 Global Office. If a URI is to a licence credential, all keys within the licence are delegated to the credential subject. If a key entry is incomplete (e.g., the delegation is for serial-level data but only the GTIN key credential is provided), all additional attributes below the path in the key are delegated to the credential subject. The delegation URIs do not need to be resolvable, and the fact that this credential is presented does not require that the delegation credentials be presented as well. It is up to the holder to decide whether to present the delegation credentials alongside this one.
