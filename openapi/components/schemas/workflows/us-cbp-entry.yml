  This workflow covers common US importing requirements pursuant to the Trade Act of 2002 and the Customs Modernization Act. 
  
  Additional data filings are often required beyond the common data elements, so please use this in conjunction with other workflows. Such circumstances include:
      - Commodity, which may require specific product certification credential and/or be subject to specific government agency requirements, 
      - Origin Country, which may require proof of origin certification and pre-registration,
      - Transport Method, entailing specific security filings. 
      - Filer Organization, which can benefit from presenting organization credentials such as CTPAT, or entail power of attourney proof requirements.  
      - Value, which may entail import bond surety requirements or requirement excemptions.
          
  The workflow is initiated by issuance (1) and presentation (2) of an Intent to Import credential, which establishes the importer of record. 
  No later than 15 days prior to goods arrival, the importer file the documents necessary to determine whether merchandise may be released from CBP custody. 
  This includes issuance (3) and presentation (4) of a 3461 Entry credential, and presentation of Commercial Invoice (5), Packing List (6) and Bill of Lading (7) credentials. 
  Upon release, CBP issues (8) and presents back (9) a PGA Shipment Status credential. 
  For duty assessment and statistical purposes, no later than 10 days after goods release the importer must issue (10) and present (11) a CBP 7501 Entry Summary credential.
