      Specify the Origin Criterion under which the good qualifies, as set out in
      Chapter 4, Article 4.2 (Originating Goods) of the USMCA/T-MEC/CUSMA
      agreement
      (https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/files/agreements/FTA/USMCA/Text/04-Rules-of-Origin.pdf).
      Criterion A: The good is wholly obtained or produced entirely in the
      territory of one or more of the USMCA/T-MEC/CUSMA countries, as defined in
      Article 4.3 of the Agreement; Criterion B: The good is produced entirely
      in the territory of one or more of the USMCA/T-MEC/CUSMA countries using
      non-originating materials, provided the good satisfies all applicable
      requirements of product-specific rules of origin; Criterion C: The good is
      produced entirely in the territory of one or more of the USMCA/T-MEC/CUSMA
      countries exclusively from originating materials; or Criterion D: The good
      is produced entirely in the territory of one or more of the
      USMCA/T-MEC/CUSMA countries. It is classified with its materials, or
      satisfies the 'unassembled goods' requirement, and meets a regional value
      content threshold of not less than 60% if the transaction value method is
      used, or not less than 50% if the net cost method is used (not including
      RVC for autos); except for goods in Chapter 61-63 of the HTS.
