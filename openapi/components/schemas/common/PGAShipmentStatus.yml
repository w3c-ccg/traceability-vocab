  Partner Government Agencies (PGAs) use PGA Status Notification Codes to communicate 
  with ACE on the following CBP documents: Entry Summary Status Notification, 
  Cargo Release Status Notification, Status notification for Stand-alone PE data submission,
  and ACE Cargo Manifest/In-Bond/Entry Status Query. Each Code provides a description 
  from the PGA explaining the current status. For reference, here is a link to the 
  CATAIR document with all approved codes:
