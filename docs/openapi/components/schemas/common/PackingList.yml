title: Packing List
description: >-
  A seller-prepared commercial document indicating the net and gross weights, dimensions and contents of all shipping pieces (boxes, crates, bundles, etc.) in a shipment. Each packing list should reference the shipment for which is made, and the line item totals should agree with the relevant commercial invoice. A packing list should be made for all shipments consisting of more than one shipping piece for the following reasons
  - They aid in identifying lost cargo, especially for carrier and insurance claims.
  - They permit selective inspection by customs authorities, and many government require them for large shipments.
  - They provide a "map" of the shipment, enabling the buyer to easily unpack and stock the shipped goods.
  In certain cases it is advisable elaborate the packing list considering the information requested by the importer, especially for customs purposes, as may be the case that the Customs request a "detailed document", for example, in the case of a machine, the identification of each of the parts and components.
