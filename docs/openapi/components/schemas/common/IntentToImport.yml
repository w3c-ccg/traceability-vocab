title: Intent To Import
description: >-
  A simple case where an entity (person or organization) wishes to notify some
  third party that they intend to import some product, likely into a different
  geographic region than that of its origin. This can be used to identify and 
  declare intent earlier in the process than would be possible otherwise. This 
  object may be easily subclassed for extension with other data for cases 
  where additional regulatory data may be required.
