description: The event type AggregationEvent describes events that apply to objects that have been aggregated to one another. In such an event, there is a set of 'contained' objects that have been aggregated within a 'containing' entity that's meant to identify the aggregation itself. This event type is intended to be used for 'aggregations', meaning an association where there is a strong physical relationship between the containing and the contained objects such that they will all occupy the same location at the same time, until such time as they are disaggregated.
