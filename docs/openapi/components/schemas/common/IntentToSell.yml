title: Intent To Sell
description: >-
  A simple case where an entity (person or organization) wishes to notify some
  third party that they intend to sell some product, likely into a different
  geographic region than in originated in.  This is a highly simplified version
  of an LOI that can be used to identify and declare intent earlier in the
  process than would be possible otherwise.  This object may be easily
  subclassed for extension with other data for other cases where additional
  regulatory data may be required
