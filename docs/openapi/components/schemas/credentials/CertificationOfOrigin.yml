description: >- 
  A document attesting to the country of origin of the goods. A certificate of origin is often required by customs authorities of a country as part of the entry process. Such certificates are usually through an official organization in the country of origin such as the local chamber of commerce or a consular office. The goods description must coincide with that provided in the commercial invoice and in the packing list (number, goods description, name of the consignor and of the consignee, trademarks, etc.). If the certificate of origin is not shown, the import customs may, if it deems it necessary, accept the dispatching of goods. In this case, the corresponding tariff would be applied to third countries (non preferential origin), without any tariff discount. Although the World Customs Organization and the World Trade Organization have tried to create a single set of origin criteria in worldwide use, none exists at this time. Some countries and free-trade zones (such as NAFTA) require that origin be certified in terms of special criteria such as tariff shift or percentage value. Traders are well advised to assure that any applicable origin rules are understood and any required documentation is obtainable before concluding sales contracts.
