description: >-
  The document recording a transaction between the seller and the buyer. Commercial invoices are normally prepared by sellers.
  The commercial invoice on itself does not grant any ownership of the goods, unless it has an attached document proving the importer's payment for the total amount. The number of copies of the invoice (both original and copies) required for the delivery of the goods, must be agreed with the importer. Usually, invoices are issued with the original and two copies. Although normally the legislation in different countries does not limit the number of originals, it is not advisable to make more than those strictly necessary in order to accomplish with the customs needs required by the buyer. It is advisable that the importer confirms with the exporter all data that the invoice must provide before its issuing, as well as the particularities it must include in order to accomplish with the regulation of the destination country.
