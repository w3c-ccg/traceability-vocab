    description: Importer of Record or Licensed Customs Broker. The importer of record or licensed customs broker must complete Part I of the NOA form. A separate NOA must be submitted for each pesticide or device in each shipment prior to its arrival at the port of entry. To expedite the handling of pesticide or device shipments, submit NOA(s) to the EPA office listed below having jurisdiction over the state/territory of the port of entry. It is recommended that all applicable blocks in Part I be completed prior to submission to EPA, and that a copy of the label affixed to the product be submitted with each NOA. Additional supporting documentation (e.g., CBP Form 7501, 3461, or 3461 ALT) for validating information provided may also be included with the submission. When providing an address, the complete address should include the mailing location, e-mail address, and telephone number of the contact person. EPA may require and request additional documentation in order to review and make final compliance determinations regarding import shipments. (FIFRA §§ 8(b) and 17(c))
