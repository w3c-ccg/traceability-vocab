      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This specification describes a Linked Data vocabulary for asserting

        <h3>Use Cases and Requirements</h3>

        <p>
          The following use cases outline a number of key scenarios that readers
          might find useful in a variety of sectors, especially those that deal
          with cross border supply chain data interchange.

          <h5>Steel and Metal Imports</h5>
          <dl class="termlist">
            <p>
              The global steel industry relies on cross-party communication of
              product and business information to successfully move materials
              from mines, to manufacturers, through customs, to end customers
              (such as automotive and construction companies). Today this
              information exists primarily in siloed paper documents. In the
              current format it is very difficult to make data comparisons
              across a small number of parties, let alone across millions of
              shipments over time. It can also be difficult to catch forged
              documents in the absence of digital signatures and clearly defined
              organization data attributes.
            </p>

            <p>
              A shared vocabulary creates opportunities for steel trading
              partners to work from a common digital representation of trade
              information. Take the example of a mill report for a steel
              product. This document provides important information about the
              chemical make-up of steel materials, helping to ensure the desired
              specification and grade have been met. It also acts as evidence
              about the origins of steel materials. Unambiguous representation
              of mill report fields is critical for assessing appropriate
              duties, meeting customer requirements, and ultimately ensuring
              consumer safely.
            </p>

            <p>
              By defining the schema for each field, importers can now answer
              questions like “How many pipes of specification XYZ did we
              purchase last year?” (i.e.,
              <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability#schemas/ChemicalProperty.json">ChemicalProperty</a>). The mill report can also be linked to other trade
              documentation such as commercial invoices and bills of lading when
              those credentials are specified and defined. Regulators can also
              ask questions across a large number of mill reports to help catch
              transshipment issues, such as “How much steel product
              imported last month specified Vietnam as the country of
              origin?” (i.e.,
              <a href="https://schema.org/addressCountry">addressCountry</a>).

          <h5>Food and Agriculture</h5>
          <p>
            Several use cases exist for common vocabulary in the food and
            agriculture space. Key priorities for this project revolve around
            items that are required for the safe and succesful importation of
            food to various countries.

            The top level
            <a href="./schemas/AgInspectionReport.json">AgInspectionReport</a>
            object has been created as a parent object that allows for the
            recording of the following inspections and audits, while giving
            flexibility to account for newly defined inspction types as needs
            change in the food and agricultre industry. This object can be
            sub-classed to allow for schema level validation of specific types
            of inspections and audits as required by the specifics of a given
            use case. Verifiable Credentials can be issued for this object or
            sub classes of this object to allow for external verification by
            third parties that are implementing the Verifiable Credentials

          <h5>Oil and Gas Imports</h5>
          <dl class="termlist">
            <p>
              A common traceability vocabulary will enable creation of a common
              digital representation of an oil and gas assets and a variety of
              use cases. The main priority of this project is the border
              clearance and regulatory compliance use cases, that enable
              industry players to rely on the asset history, origin, and
              composition recorded as Verifiable credentials to be used in these
              processes.

            <p>
              The asset-specific CrudeOil VC (and NaturalGas VC) object serves
              as a root object that stores the key attributes of the asset as
              well as origin and composition. In addition to the asset VC, we
              are planning to represent key events in the asset’s
              lifecycle (inspection, transportation, transfer of ownership) as
              Verifiable Credentials.

          <h5>E-Commerce Registration and Pre-Registration</h5>
          <dl class="termlist">
            <p>
              A common traceability vocabulary will allow complex supply chains
              that import goods to US-resident customers to register individual
              packages and pre-register products intended for sale to the US
              with US Customs. For the data needs of Customs to be met by highly
              heterogenous supply chains that might require much "internal
              confidentiality" (between supply chain actors), a highly
              sharded data model is required, whereby many different actors can
              each submit data points separately that get combined at time of
              customs processing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Without strong identification of legal entities (i.e., legally
              defined and registered supply chain actors) and of products, and
              without high levels of semantic flexibility, the shards can be
              quite hard to combine usefully. Linking the registration of
              individual packages together with the pre-registration of
              commercial products and actors is the key value-add of this
              system, but could also be a burdensome request on importers,
              retailers, and freight forwarders. To minimize this burden, we are
              aligning wherever possible with the ontology work of GS1 (GTINs
              and vLEIs), and with shipping and tracking semantics already
              adopted today by international logistics consortia. We distinguish
              between the VCs that are issued in relation to a specific package
              and the contextual information that needs to be queried to
              validate package information, as well as to make valuable
              assessments, inferences, and data quality remediation on Customs
              pre-entry data.

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        This section details the general privacy considerations and specific
        privacy implications of deploying this specification into production
        environments.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of security considerations that implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described by this specification.
        Ignoring or not understanding the implications of this section can
        result in security vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
        considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to
        seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
        implementing mission critical systems using the technology outlined in
        this specification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described in this specification. As
        with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        accessibility issues makes this information unusable to a large subset
        of the population. It is important to follow accessibility guidelines
        and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure all people, regardless of
        ability, can make use of this data. This is especially important when
        establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have historically
        created problems for assistive technologies.

      <p>
        This section details the general accessibility considerations to take
        into account when utilizing this data model.

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers
        should be aware of when publishing data described in this specification.
        As with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        internationalization makes it difficult for data to be produced and
        consumed across a disparate set of languages and societies, which would
        limit the applicability of the specification and significantly diminish
        its value as a standard.
