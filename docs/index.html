    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This specification is designed to enable global supply chain stakeholders to benefit from emerging technological web
        standards like the Verifiable Credential (VC) Data Model, Linked Data (i.e. JSON-LD), and the Decentralized Identifier
        (DID) Spec. This specification is relevant to prevalent supply chains but also allows for other use cases across a
        variety of market segments. The corresponding data exchange schemas are modeled for Verifiable Credentials, which is a
        standard for cryptographically signing business data. Schema semantics are precisely defined by use of Linked Data
        which leverage established vocabularies such as schema.org, GS1, and UN/CEFACT.
      </p>

      <h3>Supply Chain Digitization</h3>
      <p>
        While digitization has revolutionized other industries with decades of value, supply chain industries have been slow
        and fragmented in their digital transformation journey. The sheer number and variety of supply chain actors makes
        technological advances incredibly difficult. For example, physical paper, manual processing, and outdated technologies
        still support the vast majority of supply chain information flows. Paper processing costs the supply chain industry
        upwards of $3 billion every year (not counting the additional costs of paper, ink, and printing) (see "<a
          href="https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/32802-paper-the-bane-of-the-supply-chain-and-how-to-combat-it">When
          Will Supply Chains Finally Move on From Paper?</a>"). The resulting data silos and blind spots throughout the supply
        chain have
        created a crisis that enterprises and regulators can no longer ignore. This problem is made worse by the coordination
        challenges inherent in increasingly global supply chains.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as semantic standards depend on manual adoption and complex implementations, the impacts of these investments
        are limited and delayed. Semantic standards and code lists are being rigorously managed by various standards
        organizations. However, language barriers and differing contexts between standards is a major source of imprecision
        and errors. The fragmentary environment around different standard types, applications, and governing bodies only adds
        to the complexity involved in adoption and integration of standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        The identity of supply chain actors is another problem resulting in costs and errors. While nations and platforms have
        established digital identity regimes within their boundaries, no useful global identity scheme has emerged or been
        adopted. Public policy, borders, and commercial obstacles create large barriers for a global centralized model to be
        adopted. The result is that most businesses need to invest heavily in IT infrastructure and middleware data mapping
        tools to be integrated with their trading partners. In fact, digitizing a major supply chain will cost tens of
        millions of dollars at the current pace and will be a 3-to-5 year transformation effort in the future (see "<a
          href="https://hbr.org/2021/09/a-simpler-way-to-modernize-your-supply-chain">A Simpler
          Way to Modernize Your Supply Chain</a>"). Today, most enterprises only have 20% visibility into their supply chains
        when
        they need about 70% to 90% visibility to properly monitor their investments (see "<a
          href="https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/31062-in-2020-supply-chain-digitization-is-no-longer-optional">In
          2020, Supply-Chain Digitization
          Is No Longer Optional</a>"). This means a heavy investment of capital is required to achieve this visibility, which
        results in de-facto vendor software lock-in.
      </p>


      <h2>Establishing Trust</h2>
      <p>
        Trust and efficiency are fundamental to supply chains and global trade. Supply chains are a network of economically
        connected and collaborative stakeholders that includes shippers, carriers, importers, regulators, and other key
        actors. Traditionally, trust is established in the supply chain by analogue signed contracts, physical meetings, phone
        calls, faxes, and regular audits that prove credibility of the engaging parties and compliance with relevant
        regulation. Digitization efforts in the sphere of “contractual trust” have been limited by challenges like altering
        digital data such as PDFs, which is both easy to do and difficult to detect. Some noteworthy steps have been taken to
        address this such as encrypted communication channels like HTTP-over-TLS (a/k/a HTTPS) and commercial digital
        signature platforms (i.e. Docusign). However, a trusted channel does not prevent data alteration by either party and
        globally scaling a proprietary platform is expensive and comes with political and practical implications.
      </p>
      <p>
        This landscape has changed with the advent of the VC standard. This standard makes digital contractual trust
        accessible and affordable for anyone on the planet. VCs work by applying existing cryptographic standards
        (particularly modern curve-based digital signature algorithms) to business data that is typically exchanged over APIs
        or XML. The VC specification provides a data model for how data paired with a cryptographic signature should be
        represented in a data file. The data itself can be anything; it can describe a shipment, an organization, a product,
        an agreement, etc. The cryptographic signature ensures that anyone with the VC can verify that the data is how the
        issuer intended it to be. In other words, the VC standard enables the use of cryptographic standards and provides the
        verifier a sense of trust when presented with the data file from the issuer. The implications of this technology for
        global supply chains are far-reaching.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there remains a great deal of untapped potential from VCs. Trust can be established remotely and fully
        automated provided that suitable claims are presented and issued by a trustworthy third party such as an existing
        business partner, a commercial agent, or a government. "Chains of trust" can be established by linking back through
        relevant claims to a known trust anchor. As you can see, VCs have a great deal of potential in the future of supply
        chain technology.
      </p>

      <h2>Linked Semantics</h2>
      <p>
        Supply chain organizations use different words to say the same thing. For example, “Shipper” and “Consignor” are used
        interchangeably in shipping. Ensuring precise communication across supply chain participants given these varying
        vocabularies is challenging. For example, standards bodies govern semantic models with term definitions, APIs for
        common use cases, and code lists in an attempt to avoid ambiguity. The traditional challenge for these technical
        publications has been the human element: reading the spec, interpreting the API attribute name, or skimming through
        the code lists. This labor is required because the data sender and the data receiver have to establish the same
        understanding. This results in effort and IT costs for both the sender and receiver to ensure they’re communicating
        unambiguously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linked Data addresses this problem by letting computers establish semantic meaning. Leveraging how the web works,
        Linked Data explicitly ties terms to a precise Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). Much like a URL pointing at a
        specific website, a URI defines a specific term. Thus, when the data sender defines a term by pointing at a URI, no
        interpretation is needed and a computer can automatically understand it. Beyond the obvious benefit of establishing
        shared understanding, integrating Linked Data is simpler and more cost-effective than data interpretation and mapping.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linked Data is not new. It drives internet indexing and search engines. This traceability-vocab specification simply
        introduces this technology for use in the supply chain industry. All of the schemas which define the data content of
        Verifiable Credentials are constructed with explicit pointers to the most relevant URIs of the terms used. Existing
        term definitions, which are available in online vocabularies, can be used to construct the Verifiable Credential
        schemas.
      </p>

      <h2>Global Identifiers</h2>
      <p>
        A final important part of modernizing the digital supply chain is targeting the problem of identification. The
        difficulty of scaling centralized solutions has led to the emergence of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). DIDs rely on
        cryptography to prove that you are in control of a given identity. A variety of different types of DIDs exist and
        apply to different use-cases, like short-term DIDs or long-term, enterprise, security-grade DIDs. A DID is trustless,
        meaning that anyone can make and control a DID at any time. The value and credibility of a DID comes from its
        relationship with credentials that are tied to it. These credentials are typically issued by third-party organizations
        and/or governments.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the identification of supply chain parties is a major identity problem, DIDs also provide value in other
        contexts. DIDs can be used to represent products, shipments, contractual agreements, or anything else in the supply
        chain that would benefit from the properties of DIDs. When paired with DIDs representing supply chain actors, DIDs
        that represent supply chain products or shipments stand to offer an ever more granular snapshot of the supply chain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the traceability-vocab's use of Decentralized Identifiers is limited to example uses. Traditional means of
        identification can also be used, but use of DIDs is encouraged to ensure that actual control of an identity can be
        proven.
      </p>

      <h3>Technology Summary</h3>
      <p>
        This section describes the emerging technology standards of Verifiable Credentials, Linked Data, and Decentralized Identifiers with a real-world supply chain use case.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Commercial Invoice is a critical supply chain document that is essential to Customs who use it for duty
        determination and other tasks. This document includes data such as the description of the goods, where the goods are
        being shipped to and from, and the value of the goods. This document is supplied by the shipper.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Commercial Invoice document is typically exchanged via PDF, email, or EDI. With the use of Verifiable Credential
        technology, we are able to digitize a Commercial Invoice into a verifiable Commercial Invoice credential. Each data
        point on the Commercial Invoice VC is mapped to a semantic model for common definition using Linked Data. For example,
        the “Consignee” field or the “Shipper” field on the Commercial Invoice are defined unambiguously to precise URIs. This
        promotes a singular, common definition of the data labels so that organizations have a shared understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, certain data points on the Commercial Invoice are used to identify an organization. For example, the
        “Consignee” field identifies the receiver of the goods and the “Shipper” field identifies the shipper of the goods. In
        this example, both the consignee and shipper would be organizations. Using a Decentralized Identifier (DID), for
        example, the consignee organization can self-authenticate as the receiver of the goods.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Shipper’s Decentralized Identifier is included as the Verifiable Credential issuer, binding the claims on the
        Commercial Invoice back to the Shipper. Cryptographic traceability of the Commercial Invoice is thus established from
        the Shipper to the Consignee. Anyone presented with the Commercial Invoice can verify that it originates from the
        Shipper and is targeted to the Consignee.
      </p>
      <p>
        This example portrays a specific use case with a Commercial Invoice and shows how Verifiable Credentials, Linked Data,
        and Decentralized Identifiers apply. We apply these technologies to common trade documents to further digitize
        documents and promote trust throughout the entire supply chain.
      </p>

      <h2>Vocabulary</h2>
      <p>
        Generally, this vocabulary may be looked at as a set of common objects
        that are shared across multiple business verticals, and vertical or use
        case specific items that apply to one or more specific commodities or
        market segments. A primary goal of this specification is to standardize
        the creation of Verifiable Credentials from standardized JSON-LD which
        is itself created from JSON Schema definitions as would normally be
        passed of REST and other APIs. This promotes code re-use and establishes
        a pattern for the creation of JSON-LD and related Verifiable Credentials
        derived from those JSON-LD objects in a manner that is friendly to code
        and API development as well as to promote better interoperability
        between vendors who serve common or related markets.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="#vocabulary">Vocabulary</a> section covers each vocabulary
        item, its properties, other attributes, and provides and example
        Verifiable Credential for each item.
      </p>

      <p>
        This repository has primary contributors from four main market segments,
        and has subject matter experts from those market segments delegated as
        leads for objects related to vocabulary items for each segment.
        <br />
        These subject matter leads help identify common elements across
        verticals as well as in assessing contributions of new objects to the
        vocabulary.

        <p>
          The traceability-vocab ensures that coherent sets of use case-specific
          schemas, blended together with corresponding resolvable @context data,
          point all the schemas' terms to their defining URIs. These URIs will
          generally point at existing, established vocabularies. Only when no
          applicable vocabularies can be found are terms defined as part of the

          In determining the most applicable vocabulary for a particular term,
          the most generic and widely adopted vocabulary is chosen. For example,
          a common term defined in schema.org will be chosen over a similar term
          defined in a industry-specific vocabulary. This is to ensure the
          broadest possible interoperability, within and beyond supply chain.

        <h4>Steel and Metals</h4>
        <p>
          The global steel industry relies on cross-party communication of
          product and business information to successfully move materials from
          mines, to manufacturers, through customs, to end customers (such as
          automotive and construction companies). Today this information exists
          primarily in siloed paper documents. In the current format it is very
          difficult to make data comparisons across a small number of parties,
          let alone across millions of shipments over time. It can also be
          difficult to catch forged documents in the absence of digital
          signatures and clearly defined organization data attributes.
        </p>

        <p>
          A shared vocabulary creates opportunities for steel trading partners
          to work from a common digital representation of trade information.
          Take the example of a mill report for a steel product. This document
          provides important information about the chemical make-up of steel
          materials, helping to ensure the desired specification and grade have
          been met. It also acts as evidence about the origins of steel
          materials. Unambiguous representation of mill report fields is
          critical for assessing appropriate duties, meeting customer
          requirements, and ultimately ensuring consumer safely.
        </p>

        <p>
          By defining the schema for each field, importers can now answer
          questions like “How many pipes of specification XYZ did we purchase
          last year?” (i.e.,
          <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability#schemas/ChemicalProperty.json"
            >ChemicalProperty</a
          >). The mill report can also be linked to other trade documentation
          such as commercial invoices and bills of lading when those credentials
          are specified and defined. Regulators can also ask questions across a
          large number of mill reports to help catch transshipment issues, such
          as “How much steel product imported last month specified Vietnam as
          the country of origin?” (i.e.,
          <a href="https://schema.org/addressCountry">addressCountry</a>).

        <dl class="termlist">
          <p>
            A common traceability vocabulary will enable creation of a common
            digital representation of an oil and gas assets and a variety of use
            cases. The main priority of this project is the border clearance and
            regulatory compliance use cases, that enable industry players to
            rely on the asset history, origin, and composition recorded as
            Verifiable credentials to be used in these processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The asset-specific CrudeOil VC (and NaturalGas VC) object serves as
            a root object that stores the key attributes of the asset as well as
            origin and composition. In addition to the asset VC, we are planning
            to represent key events in the asset’s lifecycle (inspection,
            transportation, transfer of ownership) as Verifiable Credentials.

        <h5>E-Commerce</h5>
        <p>
          A common traceability vocabulary will allow complex supply chains that
          import goods to US-resident customers to register individual packages
          and pre-register products intended for sale to the US with US Customs.
          For the data needs of Customs to be met by highly heterogenous supply
          chains that might require much "internal confidentiality" (between
          supply chain actors), a highly sharded data model is required, whereby
          many different actors can each submit data points separately that get
          combined at time of customs processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Without strong identification of legal entities (i.e., legally defined
          and registered supply chain actors) and of products, and without high
          levels of semantic flexibility, the shards can be quite hard to
          combine usefully. Linking the registration of individual packages
          together with the pre-registration of commercial products and actors
          is the key value-add of this system, but could also be a burdensome
          request on importers, retailers, and freight forwarders. To minimize
          this burden, we are aligning wherever possible with the ontology work
          of GS1 (GTINs and vLEIs), and with shipping and tracking semantics
          already adopted today by international logistics consortia. We
          distinguish between the VCs that are issued in relation to a specific
          package and the contextual information that needs to be queried to
          validate package information, as well as to make valuable assessments,
          inferences, and data quality remediation on Customs pre-entry data.

          The product importer of record issues <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#ProformaInvoiceCredential">Proforma Invoice</a> (1) and <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#IntentToImportCredential">Intent To Import</a> (2) credentials which are presented to CBP (3) with instance id [inst_1] well ahead of shipping. 
        </p>
        <p>
          CBP verifies the initial import documentation submitted by the Importer (4).
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon shipping, the Freight Forwarder issues a <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#HouseBillOfLadingCredential">House BL</a> (5) which is presented to CBP (6) with a separate instance id [inst_2].
        </p>
        <p>
          The Importer issues the final <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#CommercialInvoiceCredential">Commercial Invoice</a> (8) which is presented to the Freight Forwarder (9) also with instance id [inst_1]. Passing on the <a href="">Commercial Invoice</a>, the Freight Forwarder includes both its own and the Importer’s instance ids [inst_1, inst_2], indicating to Customs that the workflows are related.
        </p>
        <p>
          Receiving the <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#CommercialInvoiceCredential">Commercial Invoice</a> (10), CBP can also join the two graphs, thus knowing that the original <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability/#ProformaInvoiceCredential">Proforma Invoice</a> relates to the Freight Forwarder’s presentations.

        <h5>Software Supply Chain</h5>
        <dl class="termlist">
          <p>
            Modern physical supply chains are heavily dependent upon software
            supply chains. As such, being able to secure digital services has
            become a requirement for securing physical ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with physical supply chains, customers demand vendors to take
            responsibility and prove the provenance of software products and
            platforms. Beyond organizations securing their supply chains, the
            digital supply chain has become an issue of national security.
            Notably, this led to the May 21st, 2021 US President
            <a
              href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/"
            >
              Executive Order</a
            >
            of enhancing software supply chain security, outlining minimum
            software traceability requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            One approach for increased visibility and accountability in software
            is to provide a Software Bill of Materials which allows consumers to
            understand what is in the software, much like how food ingredients
            are labeled. Software is widely built from open source and other
            types of components, and the Software Bill of Materials document
            lists all such dependencies, providing a detailed and accurate
            understanding of organizations' software infrastructure. This is key
            for remediating software vulnerability exposure and assessment of
            software licensing compliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Including the Software Bill of Materials in a Verifiable Credential
            establishes a verifiable link from the software back to its origin.

          <h4>Workflow Instance</h4>
          <p>
            Each defined workflow may be executed many times for different sets
            of inputs and among different stakeholders.
          </p>
          <p>
            We refer to Workflow Instance's as an execution of a particular
            workflow, which may or may not be formally defined.
          </p>

          <p class="note">
            An example of a workflow definition is 
            <a href="https://www.cbp.gov/trade/programs-administration/entry-summary/ace-process-and-policy">US Customs ACE Entry Summary Process</a>.
            Where specific instances are used to track cross border imports, it is important to be able to identify specific
            collections of documents associated with a given import.
            Workflow instances help achieve this by providing a topic
            identifier enabling the grouping of related credentials and presentations.
          </p>

          <p>
            We enable the grouping of all presentations related to an instance,

          <h4>Workflow Replace</h4>
          <p>
A holder MAY use the <code>replace</code> property of a <code>TraceablePresentation</code> 
to communciate to a verifier that a previous presentation should be replaced with a new presentation.
          </p>
          <p>
Holders SHOULD ensure the previous presentation was accepted before presenting a <code>replace</code> presentation.
          </p>
          <p>
Holders MUST present the same credential types that were present in the previous presentation and no new credentials.
          </p>
          <p>
The presentation <code>id</code> of the <code>replace</code> presentation MUST be unique, 
and MUST NOT be the same as any previous values presented.
          </p>
          <p>
The credential <code>id</code> of any corrected credentials MUST be unique, 
and MUST NOT be the same as any previous values presented.
          </p>
          <p>
In the example below <code>did:web:customs.broker.1.example</code> 
had made a mistake in a previous presentation, and corrects the mistake with a replace presentation.

        <p>
          There are a number of security considerations that implementers should
          be aware of when processing data described by this specification.
          Ignoring or not understanding the implications of this section can
          result in security vulnerabilities.
        </p>
  
        <p>
          While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
          considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to
          seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when

        <p>
          There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should
          be aware of when processing data described in this specification. As
          with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
          accessibility issues makes this information unusable to a large subset
          of the population. It is important to follow accessibility guidelines
          and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure all people, regardless of
          ability, can make use of this data. This is especially important when
          establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have historically
          created problems for assistive technologies.

        <p>
          There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers
          should be aware of when publishing data described in this specification.
          As with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
          internationalization makes it difficult for data to be produced and
          consumed across a disparate set of languages and societies, which would
          limit the applicability of the specification and significantly diminish
          its value as a standard.
