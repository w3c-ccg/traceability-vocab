      <h3>Use Cases and Requirements</h3>

      <p>
        The following use cases outline a number of key scenarios that readers
        might find useful in a variety of sectors, especially those that deal with
        cross border supply chain data interchange.

        <h5>Food and Agriculture</h5>
        <p>
          Several use cases exist for common vocabulary in the food and agriculture space. Key priorities for this
          project
          revolve around items that are required for the safe and succesful importation of food to various countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          The top level <a href="./schemas/AgInspectionReport.json">AgInspectionReport</a> object has been created as a
          parent
          object that allows for the recording of the following inspections and audits, while giving flexibility to
          account for
          newly defined inspction types as needs change in the food and agricultre industry. This object can be
          sub-classed to
          allow for schema level validation of specific types of inspections and audits as required by the specifics of
          a given
          use case. Verifiable Credentials can be issued for this object or sub classes of this object to allow for
          external
          verification by third parties that are implementing the Verifiable Credentials sepcification

          <p>
            A common traceability vocabulary will enable creation of a common
            digital representation of an oil and gas assets and a variety of
            use cases. The main priority of this project is the border
            clearance and regulatory compliance use cases, that enable
            industry players to rely on the asset history, origin, and
            composition recorded as Verifiable credentials to be used in these
            processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The asset-specific CrudeOil VC (and NaturalGas VC) object serves
            as a root object that stores the key attributes of the asset as
            well as origin and composition. In addition to the asset VC, we
            are planning to represent key events in the asset&#x2019;s lifecycle
            (inspection, transportation, transfer of ownership) as Verifiable
            Credentials.

    <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      This section details the general privacy considerations and specific
      privacy implications of deploying this specification into production
      environments.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of security considerations that implementers should
      be aware of when processing data described by this specification.
      Ignoring or not understanding the implications of this section can
      result in security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
      considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to
      seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
      implementing mission critical systems using the technology outlined in
      this specification.
    </p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should
      be aware of when processing data described in this specification. As
      with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
      accessibility issues makes this information unusable to a large subset
      of the population. It is important to follow accessibility guidelines
      and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure all people, regardless of
      ability, can make use of this data. This is especially important when
      establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have historically
      created problems for assistive technologies.

    <p>
      This section details the general accessibility considerations to take
      into account when utilizing this data model.

    <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers
      should be aware of when publishing data described in this specification.
      As with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
      internationalization makes it difficult for data to be produced and
      consumed across a disparate set of languages and societies, which would
      limit the applicability of the specification and significantly diminish
      its value as a standard.

      take into account when utilizing this data model.
