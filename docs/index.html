      This repository will be versioned at periodic points in time with a Q1 Calendar Year target for major releases.  
      Versioning tags will follow a pattern of `[MAJOR].[MINOR].[PATCH]` 
      <br><br>
      Version Definitions:
      </p><ul>
        <li>MAJOR - significant changes rolled forward from the previous major version.  Major versions MAY include breaking or non-backwards compatible changes</li>
        <li>MINOR - backwards compatible changes that may introduce new functionality or extensions of objects that are backwards compatible</li>
        <li>PATCH - minor changes that are non breaking and resolve discovered issues or bugs</li>
      </ul>
      As a rule, versioning will follow the specification outlined in the <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning 2.0</a> spec

      This approach to versioning gives the ability to integrate with and provided automated testing and validation against defined types without worry of instability or breaking changes being introduced, while also limiting the frequency of possibly breaking changes to prevent a large number of incompatible versions.

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
      This specification describes a Linked Data vocabulary for asserting
      Verifiable Credentials related to traceability information, such as
      chemical properties, mechanical properties, country of origin, and other
      attributes used to determine the status of a products and materials in a
      supply chain.

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Use Cases and Requirements</h3>

      <p>
        The following use cases outline a number of key scenarios that readers
        might find useful in a variety of sectors, especially those that deal with
        cross border supply chain data interchange.
      </p>

        <h5>Steel and Metal Imports</h5>
        <dl class="termlist">
              <p>The global steel industry relies on cross-party communication of product and business information to
                successfully move materials from mines, to manufacturers, through customs, to end customers (such as
                automotive and construction companies). Today this information exists primarily in siloed paper
                documents. In the current format it is very difficult to make data comparisons across a small number of
                parties, let alone across millions of shipments over time. It can also be difficult to catch forged
                documents in the absence of digital signatures and clearly defined organization data attributes.</p>

              <p>A shared vocabulary creates opportunities for steel trading partners to work from a common digital
                representation of trade information. Take the example of a mill report for a steel product. This
                document provides important information about the chemical make-up of steel materials, helping to ensure
                the desired specification and grade have been met. It also acts as evidence about the origins of steel
                materials. Unambiguous representation of mill report fields is critical for assessing appropriate
                duties, meeting customer requirements, and ultimately ensuring consumer safely.</p>

              <p>By defining the schema for each field, importers can now answer questions like &#x201C;How many pipes of
                specification XYZ did we purchase last year?&#x201D; (i.e., 
                <a href="https://w3id.org/traceability#schemas/ChemicalProperty.json">ChemicalProperty</a>).
                The mill report can also be linked to
                other trade documentation such as commercial invoices and bills of lading when those credentials are
                specified and defined. Regulators can also ask questions
                across a large number of mill reports to help catch transshipment issues, such as &#x201C;How much steel
                product imported last month specified Vietnam as the country of origin?&#x201D; (i.e., 
                <a href="https://schema.org/addressCountry">addressCountry</a>).</p>

        <h5>Food and Agriculture</h5>
        <p>
          Several use cases exist for common vocabulary in the food and agriculture space. Key priorities for this
          project
          revolve around items that are required for the safe and succesful importation of food to various countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          The top level <a href="./schemas/AgInspectionReport.json">AgInspectionReport</a> object has been created as a
          parent
          object that allows for the recording of the following inspections and audits, while giving flexibility to
          account for
          newly defined inspction types as needs change in the food and agricultre industry. This object can be
          sub-classed to
          allow for schema level validation of specific types of inspections and audits as required by the specifics of
          a given
          use case. Verifiable Credentials can be issued for this object or sub classes of this object to allow for
          external
          verification by third parties that are implementing the Verifiable Credentials sepcification

        <h5>Oil and Gas Imports</h5>
        <dl class="termlist">
          <p>
            A common traceability vocabulary will enable creation of a common
            digital representation of an oil and gas assets and a variety of
            use cases. The main priority of this project is the border
            clearance and regulatory compliance use cases, that enable
            industry players to rely on the asset history, origin, and
            composition recorded as Verifiable credentials to be used in these
            processes.
          </p>
          <p>
            The asset-specific CrudeOil VC (and NaturalGas VC) object serves
            as a root object that stores the key attributes of the asset as
            well as origin and composition. In addition to the asset VC, we
            are planning to represent key events in the asset&#x2019;s lifecycle
            (inspection, transportation, transfer of ownership) as Verifiable
            Credentials.
          </p>
        </dl>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h5>E-Commerce Registration and Pre-Registration</h5>
        <dl class="termlist">
          <p>
            A common traceability vocabulary will allow complex supply chains
            that import goods to US-resident customers to register individual
            packages and pre-register products intended for sale to the US with
            US Customs. For the data needs of Customs to be met by highly
            heterogenous supply chains that might require much &quot;internal
            confidentiality&quot; (between supply chain actors), a highly sharded
            data model is required, whereby many different actors can each
            submit data points separately that get combined at time of customs
            processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without strong identification of legal entities (i.e.,
            legally defined and registered supply chain actors) and of products,
            and without high levels of semantic flexibility, the shards can be
            quite hard to combine usefully. Linking the registration of individual
            packages together with the pre-registration of commercial products
            and actors is the key value-add of this system, but could also be a
            burdensome request on importers, retailers, and freight forwarders.
            To minimize this burden, we are aligning wherever possible with the
            ontology work of GS1 (GTINs and vLEIs), and with shipping and 
            tracking semantics already adopted today by international
            logistics consortia. We distinguish between the VCs that are
            issued in relation to a specific package and the contextual information
            that needs to be queried to validate package information, as well as
            to make valuable assessments, inferences, and data quality remediation
            on Customs pre-entry data.

    <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      This section details the general privacy considerations and specific
      privacy implications of deploying this specification into production
      environments.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of security considerations that implementers should
      be aware of when processing data described by this specification.
      Ignoring or not understanding the implications of this section can
      result in security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
      considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to
      seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
      implementing mission critical systems using the technology outlined in
      this specification.
    </p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should
      be aware of when processing data described in this specification. As
      with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
      accessibility issues makes this information unusable to a large subset
      of the population. It is important to follow accessibility guidelines
      and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure all people, regardless of
      ability, can make use of this data. This is especially important when
      establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have historically
      created problems for assistive technologies.

    <p>
      This section details the general accessibility considerations to take
      into account when utilizing this data model.

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers
      should be aware of when publishing data described in this specification.
      As with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
      internationalization makes it difficult for data to be produced and
      consumed across a disparate set of languages and societies, which would
      limit the applicability of the specification and significantly diminish
      its value as a standard.
