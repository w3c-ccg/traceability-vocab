          The following use cases outline a number of key scenarios that readers
          might find useful in a variety of sectors, especially those that deal with 
          cross border supply chain data interchange.

            Several use cases exist for common vocabulary in the food and agriculture space. Key priorities for this project
            revolve around items that are required for the safe and succesful importation of food to various countries.
          </p>
          <p>
            The top level <a href="./schemas/AgInspectionReport.json">AgInspectionReport</a> object has been created as a parent
            object that allows for the recording of the following inspections and audits, while giving flexibility to account for
            newly defined inspction types as needs change in the food and agricultre industry. This object can be sub-classed to
            allow for schema level validation of specific types of inspections and audits as required by the specifics of a given
            use case. Verifiable Credentials can be issued for this object or sub classes of this object to allow for external
            verification by third parties that are implementing the Verifiable Credentials sepcification

            <p>
              A common traceability vocabulary will enable creation of a common
              digital representation of an oil and gas assets and a variety of
              use cases. The main priority of this project is the border
              clearance and regulatory compliance use cases, that enable
              industry players to rely on the asset history, origin, and
              composition recorded as Verifiable credentials to be used in these
              processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The asset-specific CrudeOil VC (and NaturalGas VC) object serves
              as a root object that stores the key attributes of the asset as
              well as origin and composition. In addition to the asset VC, we
              are planning to represent key events in the asset&#x2019;s lifecycle
              (inspection, transportation, transfer of ownership) as Verifiable
              Credentials.

      <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        This section details the general privacy considerations and specific
        privacy implications of deploying this specification into production
        environments.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of security considerations that implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described by this specification.
        Ignoring or not understanding the implications of this section can
        result in security vulnerabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
        considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to
        seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
        implementing mission critical systems using the technology outlined in
        this specification.
      </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described in this specification. As
        with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        accessibility issues makes this information unusable to a large subset
        of the population. It is important to follow accessibility guidelines
        and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure all people, regardless of
        ability, can make use of this data. This is especially important when
        establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have historically
        created problems for assistive technologies.

        into account when utilizing this data model.

      <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers
        should be aware of when publishing data described in this specification.
        As with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        internationalization makes it difficult for data to be produced and
        consumed across a disparate set of languages and societies, which would
        limit the applicability of the specification and significantly diminish
        its value as a standard.
