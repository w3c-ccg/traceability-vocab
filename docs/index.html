      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>
        This specification is designed to enable global supply chain stakeholders to leverage the benefits of emerging
        technological web standards, specifically Linked Data (JSON-LD), the Verifiable Credential (VC) Data Model, and the
        Decentralized Identifier (DID) Spec. It addresses prevalent supply chain, and allows for other provenance, use cases across a variety of market
        segments. The corresponding data exchange schemas are modeled for Verifiable Credentials, which is a standard for
        cryptographically signing business data. Schema semantics are precisely defined by use of Linked Data, leveraging
        established vocabularies such as schema.org, GS1, and UN/CEFACT, enabling interoperability and digitization.
      </p>

      <h3>Supply Chain Digitization Challenges</h3>
      <p>
        While digitization has revolutionized other industries with decades worth of value already created, supply chains at
        large have been slow and fragmented in their digital transformation journey, having yet to reap the full benefits. The
        sheer number and heterogeneity of involved actors makes technological advances incredibly difficult; physical paper,
        manual processing, and outdated technologies still support the vast majority of all supply chain information flows.
        Paper processing costs the supply-chain industry upwards of $3 billion every year (not counting the additional costs of
        paper, ink, and printing)
        (see "<a href="https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/32802-paper-the-bane-of-the-supply-chain-and-how-to-combat-it">When Will Supply Chains Finally Move on From Paper?</a>").
        The resulting data silos and blind spots throughout the supply chain have created an
        enormous problem that enterprises and regulators can no longer ignore &mdash; in a space where the inherent global nature of
        supply chains is itself a coordination obstacle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Semantic standards and code lists are being rigorously managed by various standards organizations. However, as long as
        these publications depend on manual adoption and/or complex implementation, the actual impacts of these investments are
        limited and delayed. Language barriers and differing contexts is a major source of imprecision and errors. Even
        today, most enterprises have only 20% visibility into their supply chains, as opposed to the 70% to 90% percent
        needed to monitor these investments
        (see "<a href="https://www.supplychainbrain.com/blogs/1-think-tank/post/31062-in-2020-supply-chain-digitization-is-no-longer-optional">In 2020, Supply-Chain Digitization Is No Longer Optional</a>").
        The identity of supply chain actors is a separate problem resulting in costs and
        errors. While nations and platforms have established digital identity regimes within their relevant boundaries, no
        useful global identity scheme has emerged, never mind been adopted. Public policy, borders, and commercial obstacles
        create large barriers for a global centralized model to be adopted. The result of this is that most businesses need to
        invest heavily in IT infrastructure and middleware data mapping tools to be integrated with their trading partners. In
        fact, digitizing a major supply chain will cost tens of millions of dollars at the current pace and be a three to five
        year transformation effort (see "<a href="https://hbr.org/2021/09/a-simpler-way-to-modernize-your-supply-chain">A Simpler Way to Modernize Your Supply Chain</a>"). This means a heavy
        investment of capital, resulting in de-facto vendor software lock-in.
      </p>

      <h2>Technology Enablement</h2>
      <h3>Establishing Trust</h3>
      <p>
        Trust is fundamental to trade. As global citizens, we rely on efficient supply chains, and the supply chains
        themselves are actually a network of collaborative stakeholders who are economically reliant on one another &mdash; from
        shippers and carriers to importers to regulators. Traditionally, trust is established by analogue signed contracts,
        physical meetings, phone calls, faxes, and regular audits that prove credibility of the engaging parties and
        compliance with relevant regulation. Digitization efforts in the sphere of “contractual trust” have been limited by the
        fact that altering digital data &mdash; like PDFs &mdash; is incredibly easy to do and difficult to detect. Noteworthy steps taken
        to address this are encrypted communication channels, like HTTP-over-TLS a/k/a HTTPS, and commercial digital signature platforms. However, a
        trusted channel does not prevent data alteration by either party, and globally scaling a fully proprietary platform is
        inherently expensive, with political and practical implications.
      </p>
      <p>
        This landscape has changed with the advent of the Verifiable Credentials standard, which makes digital contractual
        trust accessible and affordable to use for anyone on the planet. Essentially, Verifiable Credentials apply existing
        cryptographic standards (particularly modern curve-based digital signature algorithms) to business data that is
        typically exchanged over APIs or XML. The Verifiable Credentials specification provides a data model for how data
        along with a cryptographic signature should be represented in a data file. The data itself can be anything &mdash;
        describing a shipment, an organization, a product, an agreement, etc. The cryptographic element ensures that anyone
        being presented with the data file can verify that the data is how the issuer intended it to be. In other words, the use of
        cryptographic standards provides the verifier a sense of trust when presented with the data file from the issuer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The implications for global supply chains are immense. The analogue equivalent of contractual binding by
        applying a signature is obvious, and it should be noted that a cryptographic signature is much safer from a security
        point of view.
        <br />
        The possibilities go much further. Trust can be established remotely and fully automated, provided suitable claims are
        presented and issued by a trustworthy third party, such as an existing business partner, a commercial agent, or a
        government. "Chains of trust" can be established by linking back through relevant claims to a known trust anchor.
      </p>

      <h3>Linked Semantics</h3>
      <p>
        Throughout the supply chain, organizations use different words to say the same thing. For example, “Shipper” and
        “Consignor” are used interchangeably in shipping. A lot of effort goes into ensuring precise communication
        across supply chain participants with these varying vocabularies. Standards bodies govern semantic models with term
        definitions, APIs for common use cases, and code lists in an attempt to avoid ambiguity. The traditional challenge of
        such technical publications has been the human element: reading the spec, interpreting the API attribute name, or
        skimming through the code lists, the data sender and data receiver have to establish the same understanding. This
        results in effort and IT costs for both the sender and receiver to ensure this common understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linked Data addresses this problem by letting computers establish the semantic meaning. Leveraging how the web works,
        Linked Data explicitly ties every term used to a precise Uniform Resource Identifier (URI). Much like a URL pointing
        at a specific website, a URI defines a specific term. Thus, when the data sender defines a term by pointing at a URI,
        there is no interpretation to be done, as the receiving computer can automatically understand it. Beyond the obvious
        benefit of establishing shared understanding, integrating Linked Data is simpler, avoiding the cost and complexity of
        data interpretation and mapping.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linked Data is not new; it is what drives internet indexing and search engines. This traceability-vocab specification
        introduces this technology for use in the supply chain industry. Sometimes this approach is referred to as "Web 3.0."
        All the schemas which define the data content of Verifiable Credentials are constructed with explicit pointers to the
        most relevant URIs of the terms used. Existing term definitions, which are available in online vocabularies, can be
        used to construct the Verifiable Credential schemas.
      </p>

      <h3>Global Identification Scheme</h3>
      <p>
        A final important part of modernizing the digital supply chain is targeting the problem of identification. The
        problems of scaling centralized solutions has led to the emergence of Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs). These also
        rely on modern use of cryptography, used here to prove that you are in control of a given identity. A variety of
        different types of DIDs exist, serving different requirements from a one-off usage to an enterprise-security grade
        organization long-term representation. In itself, a DID is trustless, meaning that anyone can make and control a DID at any
        time. The value of a DID comes from the credentials tied to it, typically by other organizations and/or governments.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the main identity problem has to do with identification of supply chain parties, whether these be persons or
        organizations, DIDs can just as well represent products, shipments, contractual agreements, or anything else needing
        identification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that traceability-vocab's use of Decentralized Identifiers is limited to example uses. Traditional means of
        identification can also be used, but use of DIDs is encouraged to ensure that actual control of an identity can be proven.
      </p>

      <h3>Technology Summary</h3>
      <p>
        This section conceptualizes the introduced emerging technology standards &mdash; Verifiable Credentials, Linked Data, and
        Decentralized Identifiers &mdash; with a real-world supply chain use case.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Commercial Invoice is a critical supply chain document, essential to customs, where it is used for duty
        determination, among others. This document includes the description of the goods, where the goods are being shipped from and
        to, and a value of the goods, just to name a few of the data points. This document is supplied by the shipper.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Commercial Invoice document is typically exchanged via PDF, email, or EDI. With the use of Verifiable Credential
        technology, we are able to digitize a Commercial Invoice into a verifiable Commercial Invoice credential. Each
        data point on the Commercial Invoice VC is mapped to a semantic model for common definition using Linked Data.
        For example, the “Consignee” field or the “Shipper” field on the Commercial Invoice are defined
        unambiguously to precise URIs. This promotes a singular, common definition of the data labels so that organizations
        have a shared understanding.
        <br />
        In addition, certain data points on the Commercial Invoice are used to identify an organization. For example,
        the “Consignee” field identifies who the receiver of the goods is, and the “Shipper” field identifies who the
        shipper of the goods is. Each “who” in our example is an organization. Using a Decentralized Identifier (DID),
        for example, the consignee organization can self-authenticate as the receiver of the goods.
        <br />
        The Shipper’s Decentralized Identifier is included as the Verifiable Credential issuer, binding the claims on the
        Commercial Invoice back to the Shipper. Cryptographic traceability of the Commercial Invoice is thus established from
        the Shipper to the Consignee; anyone to whom the Commercial Invoice is presented can verify that it originates from the
        Shipper and is targeted to the Consignee.
      </p>
      <p>
        This example portrays a specific use case with a Commercial Invoice and shows how Verifiable Credentials, Linked Data, and
        Decentralized Identifiers apply. We apply these technologies to common trade documents in hopes to further digitize
        documents and promote trust throughout the entire supply chain.
      </p>

      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>
        Generally, this vocabulary may be looked at as a set of common objects
        that are shared across multiple business verticals, and vertical or
        use case specific items that apply to one or more specific commodities
        or market segments. A primary goal of this specification is to
        standardize the creation of Verifiable Credentials from standardized
        JSON-LD which is itself created from JSON Schema definitions as would
        normally be passed of REST and other APIs.  This promotes code re-use
        and establishes a pattern for the creation of JSON-LD and related
        Verifiable Credentials derived from those JSON-LD objects in a manner
        that is friendly to code and API development as well as to promote
        better interoperability between vendors who serve common or related
        markets.
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="#vocabulary">Vocabulary</a> section covers each vocabulary
        item, its properties, other attributes, and provides and example
        Verifiable Credential for each item.
      </p>

      <p>
        This repository has primary contributors from four main market segments,
        and has subject matter experts from those market segments delegated
        as leads for objects related to vocabulary items for each segment.
        <br />
        These subject matter leads help identify common elements across verticals
        as well as in assessing contributions of new objects to the vocabulary.

          The traceability-vocab ensures that coherent sets of use case-specific
          schemas, blended together with corresponding resolvable @context data,
          point all the schemas' terms to their defining URIs. These URIs will
          generally point at existing, established vocabularies. Only when no
          applicable vocabularies can be found are terms defined as part of the
          traceability-vocab spec; these are considered exceptional cases.
        </p>
        <p>
          In determining the most applicable vocabulary for a particular term,
          the most generic and widely adopted vocabulary is chosen. For example,
          a common term defined in schema.org will be chosen over a similar term
          defined in a industry-specific vocabulary. This is to ensure the
          broadest possible interoperability, within and beyond supply chain.

            be used to group and associate the nodes as those goods move from the origination
            point (a node) to the end destination. Any change in state, location, or
            control (legal or physical responsibility of some kind for the goods) would be
            described as a node represented by a VP which has the PATH CORRELATION ID

          The following use cases outline a number of key scenarios that readers

          <h4>Steel and Metals</h4>
          <p>
            The global steel industry relies on cross-party communication of
            product and business information to successfully move materials
            from mines, to manufacturers, through customs, to end customers
            (such as automotive and construction companies). Today this
            information exists primarily in siloed paper documents. In the
            current format it is very difficult to make data comparisons
            across a small number of parties, let alone across millions of
            shipments over time. It can also be difficult to catch forged
            documents in the absence of digital signatures and clearly defined
            organization data attributes.
          </p>

          <p>
            A shared vocabulary creates opportunities for steel trading
            partners to work from a common digital representation of trade
            information. Take the example of a mill report for a steel
            product. This document provides important information about the
            chemical make-up of steel materials, helping to ensure the desired
            specification and grade have been met. It also acts as evidence
            about the origins of steel materials. Unambiguous representation
            of mill report fields is critical for assessing appropriate
            duties, meeting customer requirements, and ultimately ensuring
            consumer safely.
          </p>

          <p>
            By defining the schema for each field, importers can now answer
            questions like “How many pipes of specification XYZ did we
            purchase last year?” (i.e.,
            <a
              href="https://w3id.org/traceability#schemas/ChemicalProperty.json"
              >ChemicalProperty</a
            >). The mill report can also be linked to other trade
            documentation such as commercial invoices and bills of lading when
            those credentials are specified and defined. Regulators can also
            ask questions across a large number of mill reports to help catch
            transshipment issues, such as “How much steel product imported
            last month specified Vietnam as the country of origin?” (i.e.,
            <a href="https://schema.org/addressCountry">addressCountry</a>).

          <p>
            A common traceability vocabulary will allow complex supply chains
            that import goods to US-resident customers to register individual
            packages and pre-register products intended for sale to the US
            with US Customs. For the data needs of Customs to be met by highly
            heterogenous supply chains that might require much "internal
            confidentiality" (between supply chain actors), a highly sharded
            data model is required, whereby many different actors can each
            submit data points separately that get combined at time of customs
            processing.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without strong identification of legal entities (i.e., legally
            defined and registered supply chain actors) and of products, and
            without high levels of semantic flexibility, the shards can be
            quite hard to combine usefully. Linking the registration of
            individual packages together with the pre-registration of
            commercial products and actors is the key value-add of this
            system, but could also be a burdensome request on importers,
            retailers, and freight forwarders. To minimize this burden, we are
            aligning wherever possible with the ontology work of GS1 (GTINs
            and vLEIs), and with shipping and tracking semantics already
            adopted today by international logistics consortia. We distinguish
            between the VCs that are issued in relation to a specific package
            and the contextual information that needs to be queried to
            validate package information, as well as to make valuable
            assessments, inferences, and data quality remediation on Customs
            pre-entry data.

        <h5>Software Supply Chain</h5>
        <dl class="termlist">
          <p>
            Modern physical supply chains are heavily dependent upon software supply chains. As such, being able to
            secure digital services has become a requirement for securing physical ones.
          </p>
          <p>
            As with physical supply chains, customers demand vendors to take responsibility and prove the provenance
            of software products and platforms. Beyond organizations securing their supply chains, the digital supply
            chain has become an issue of national security. Notably, this led to the May 21st, 2021 US President
            <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/">
            Executive Order</a> of enhancing software supply chain security, outlining minimum software traceability
            requirements.
          </p>
          <p>
            One approach for increased visibility and accountability in software is to provide a Software Bill of Materials
            which allows consumers to understand what is in the software, much like how food ingredients are labeled.
            Software is widely built from open source and other types of components, and the Software Bill of Materials
            document lists all such dependencies, providing a detailed and accurate understanding of organizations'
            software infrastructure. This is key for remediating software vulnerability exposure and assessment of software
            licensing compliance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Including the Software Bill of Materials in a Verifiable Credential establishes a verifiable link from the
            software back to its origin.

      <p>
        While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
        considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to
        seek the advice of security and cryptography professionals when
        implementing mission critical systems using the technology outlined in

      <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

      <p>
        There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should
        be aware of when processing data described in this specification. As
        with any web standards or protocols implementation, ignoring
        accessibility issues makes this information unusable to a large subset
        of the population. It is important to follow accessibility guidelines
        and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure all people, regardless of
        ability, can make use of this data. This is especially important when
        establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which have historically
        created problems for assistive technologies.
