    "description": "ISO 1352:2011 specifies the conditions for performing torsional, constant-amplitude, nominally elastic stress fatigue tests on metallic specimens without deliberately introducing stress concentrations. The tests are carried out at ambient temperature (ideally at between 10 °C and 35 °C) in air by applying a pure couple to the specimen about its longitudinal axis."
